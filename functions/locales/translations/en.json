      "paragraph2": "Data regarding the reported incident and/or contact details may also be collected from other sources during the investigation and/or follow-up of the report. It is noted that all channels of the Organization's Internal Reporting Channel allow you to submit your report either with your name or anonymously. However, the Data Controller encourages you to submit your report with your name, as this adds greater credibility to the content of the report and your intentions, while facilitating communication between the reporter and the Organization's Report Reception and Follow-up Officer (for reports not submitted through the platform) both for further clarifications and for informing you about the progress of the report. If you provide any personal data of third parties, you must comply with the lawful conditions for transmitting such data to the Data Controller for the purposes specified in this Policy. The data must be absolutely necessary and appropriate for achieving the purposes of Law 4990/2022 (protection of persons reporting breaches of Union law from retaliation). Personal data that obviously do not relate to the report or are excessive should not be submitted, as otherwise they will not be further processed and will be deleted immediately."

The legal basis for such processing is Article 6(1)(e) of the GDPR, which allows the Data Controller to process personal data when this is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, which stems from the provisions of Articles 8 to 12 and 15 of Law 4990/2022. Regarding special categories of data that you may submit with your report or that may arise during its investigation and/or follow-up, their processing is carried out on the basis provided by Articles 9(2)(g) and 10 of the GDPR. In case the Data Controller uses your personal data for other purposes not mentioned above, it will inform you about the specific purposes and, when required, on what basis it does so, at the time it collects personal data from you and to the extent required by applicable legislation."

    "disclosure": {

More specifically, the Data Controller is entitled to disclose your personal data to third party entities, authorities or persons only in cases required by Union or national law, in the context of investigations by competent authorities or in the context of judicial procedures and provided that this is necessary for serving the purposes of Law 4990/2022 or for safeguarding the superior rights of the reported person. The aforementioned transmission of your data can only take place after prior written notification to you regarding the reasons for disclosing your identity and other confidential information, unless your notification undermines investigations or judicial procedures. After notification, you have the right to submit written observations to the Data Controller, which are not disclosed to anyone. The Data Controller evaluates them and in case it considers that the raised reasons are not sufficient, it may proceed to disclose your identity and other confidential elements. Any access to personal data is made to the extent necessary for achieving the pursued purpose. Personal data may also be disclosed to third parties upon request and with your consent, subject to the provisions of Chapter F of Law 4990/2022."
